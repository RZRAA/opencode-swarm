# 🐝 OpenCode Swarm

**Your AI writes the code. Swarm makes sure it actually works.**

OpenCode Swarm is a plugin for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) that turns a single AI coding agent into a team of nine. One agent writes the code. A different agent reviews it. Another writes and runs tests. Another catches security issues. Nothing ships until every check passes. Your project state is saved to disk, so you can close your laptop, come back tomorrow, and pick up exactly where you left off.

```bash
npm install -g opencode-swarm
```

That's it. Open your project with `opencode` and start building. Swarm activates automatically.

---

## What Actually Happens

You say: *"Build me a JWT auth system."*

Here's what Swarm does behind the scenes:

1. **Asks you clarifying questions** (only the ones it can't figure out itself)
2. **Scans your codebase** to understand what already exists
3. **Consults domain experts** (security, API design, whatever your project needs) and caches the guidance so it never re-asks
4. **Writes a phased plan** with concrete tasks, acceptance criteria, and dependencies
5. **A separate critic agent reviews the plan** before any code is written
6. **Implements one task at a time.** For each task:
   - A coder agent writes the code
   - 7 automated checks run (syntax, imports, linting, secrets, security, build, quality)
   - A reviewer agent (running on a *different* AI model) checks for correctness
   - A test engineer agent writes tests, runs them, and checks coverage
   - If anything fails, it goes back to the coder with specific feedback
   - If it passes everything, the task is marked done and the next one starts
7. **After each phase completes**, documentation updates automatically, and a retrospective captures what worked and what didn't. Those learnings carry into the next phase.

All of this state lives in a `.swarm/` folder in your project:

```
.swarm/
├── plan.md       # Your project roadmap (tasks, status, what's done, what's next)
├── context.md    # Decisions made, expert guidance, established patterns
├── evidence/     # Review verdicts, test results, diffs for every completed task
└── history/      # Phase retrospectives and metrics
```

Close your terminal. Come back next week. Swarm reads these files and picks up exactly where it stopped.

---

## Why This Exists

Most AI coding tools let one model write code and then ask *that same model* if the code is good. That's like asking someone to proofread their own essay. They'll miss the same things they missed while writing it.

Swarm fixes this by splitting the work across specialized agents and requiring that different models handle writing vs. reviewing. The coder writes. A different model reviews. Another model tests. Different training data, different blind spots, different failure modes.

The other thing most tools get wrong: they try to do everything in parallel. That sounds fast, but in practice you get three agents writing conflicting code at the same time with no coordination. Swarm runs one task at a time through a fixed pipeline. Slower per-task, but you don't redo work.

---

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm install -g opencode-swarm
```

### Verify

Open a project with `opencode` and run:

```
/swarm diagnose
```

This checks that everything is wired up correctly.

### Configure Models (Optional)

By default, Swarm uses whatever model OpenCode is configured with. To route different agents to different models (recommended), create `.opencode/swarm.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "architect": { "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6" },
    "coder":     { "model": "minimax-coding-plan/MiniMax-M2.5" },
    "reviewer":  { "model": "zai-coding-plan/glm-5" }
  }
}
```

You only need to specify the agents you want to override. The rest use the default.

### Start Building

Just tell OpenCode what you want to build. Swarm handles the rest.

```
> Build a REST API with user registration, login, and JWT auth
```

Use `/swarm status` at any time to see where things stand.

## Useful Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/swarm status` | Where am I? Current phase, task progress |
| `/swarm plan` | Show the full project plan |
| `/swarm diagnose` | Health check, is everything configured right? |
| `/swarm evidence 2.1` | Show review/test results for a specific task |
| `/swarm history` | What's been completed so far |
| `/swarm reset --confirm` | Start over (clears all swarm state) |

---

## The Agents

Swarm has nine agents. You don't interact with them directly. The architect orchestrates everything.

| Agent | Role | When It Runs |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **architect** | Plans the project, delegates tasks, enforces quality gates | Always (it's the coordinator) |
| **explorer** | Scans your codebase to understand what exists | Before planning, after each phase |
| **sme** | Domain expert (security, APIs, databases, whatever is needed) | During planning, guidance is cached |
| **critic** | Reviews the plan before any code is written | After planning, before execution |
| **coder** | Writes code, one task at a time | During execution |
| **reviewer** | Reviews code for correctness and security issues | After every task |
| **test_engineer** | Writes and runs tests, including adversarial edge cases | After every task |
| **designer** | Generates UI scaffolds and design tokens (opt-in) | Before UI tasks |
| **docs** | Updates documentation to match what was actually built | After each phase |

## How It Compares

| | OpenCode Swarm | oh-my-opencode | get-shit-done |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Multiple specialized agents | ✅ 9 agents | ❌ Prompt config | ❌ Single-agent macros |
| Plan reviewed before coding starts | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Every task reviewed + tested | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Different model for review vs. coding | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Saves state to disk, resumable | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Security scanning built in | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Learns from its own mistakes | ✅ (retrospectives) | ❌ | ❌ |

<summary><strong>Full Execution Pipeline (Technical Detail)</strong></summary>

### The Pipeline

Every task goes through this sequence. No exceptions, no overrides.

```
MODE: EXECUTE (per task)
│
├── 5a. @coder implements (ONE task only)
├── 5b. diff + imports (contract + dependency analysis)
├── 5c. syntax_check (parse validation)
├── 5d. placeholder_scan (catches TODOs, stubs, incomplete code)
├── 5e. lint fix → lint check
├── 5f. build_check (does it compile?)
├── 5g. pre_check_batch (4 parallel: lint, secretscan, SAST, quality budget)
├── 5h. @reviewer (correctness pass)
├── 5i. @reviewer (security pass, if security-sensitive files changed)
├── 5j. @test_engineer (verification tests + coverage ≥70%)
├── 5k. @test_engineer (adversarial tests)
├── 5l. ⛔ Pre-commit checklist (all 4 items required, no override)
└── 5m. Task marked complete, evidence written
```

If any step fails, the coder gets structured feedback and retries. After 5 failures on the same task, it escalates to you.

### Architect Workflow Modes

The architect moves through these modes automatically:

| Mode | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| `RESUME` | Checks if `.swarm/plan.md` exists, picks up where it left off |
| `CLARIFY` | Asks you questions (only what it can't infer) |
| `DISCOVER` | Explorer scans the codebase |
| `CONSULT` | SME agents provide domain guidance |
| `PLAN` | Architect writes the phased plan |
| `CRITIC-GATE` | Critic reviews the plan (max 2 revision cycles) |
| `EXECUTE` | Tasks are implemented one at a time through the QA pipeline |
| `PHASE-WRAP` | Phase completes, docs update, retrospective written |

### plan.md: Your Project Roadmap

```markdown
# Project: Auth System
Current Phase: 2

## Phase 1: Foundation [COMPLETE]
- [x] Task 1.1: Create user model [SMALL]
- [x] Task 1.2: Add password hashing [SMALL]
- [x] Task 1.3: Database migrations [MEDIUM]

## Phase 2: Core Auth [IN PROGRESS]
- [x] Task 2.1: Login endpoint [MEDIUM]
- [ ] Task 2.2: JWT generation [MEDIUM] (depends: 2.1) ← CURRENT
  - Acceptance: Returns valid JWT with user claims, 15-minute expiry
  - Attempt 1: REJECTED — missing expiration claim
- [ ] Task 2.3: Token validation middleware [MEDIUM]
```

### context.md: What's Been Decided

```markdown
## Technical Decisions
- bcrypt cost factor: 12
- JWT TTL: 15 minutes; refresh TTL: 7 days

## SME Guidance (cached, never re-asked)
### security (Phase 1)
- Never log tokens or passwords
- Rate-limit login: 5 attempts / 15 min per IP

### api (Phase 1)
- Return 401 for invalid credentials (not 404)
```

### Evidence Bundles

Every completed task writes structured evidence to `.swarm/evidence/`:

| Type | What It Captures |
|------|--------------------|
| review | Verdict, risk level, specific issues |
| test | Pass/fail counts, coverage %, failure messages |
| diff | Files changed, additions/deletions |
| retrospective | Phase metrics, lessons learned (injected into next phase) |

<summary><strong>Guardrails and Circuit Breakers</strong></summary>

Every agent runs inside a circuit breaker that kills runaway behavior before it burns your credits.

| Signal | Default Limit | What Happens |
|--------|:---:|-------------|
| Tool calls | 200 | Agent is stopped |
| Duration | 30 min | Agent is stopped |
| Same tool repeated | 10x | Agent is warned, then stopped |
| Consecutive errors | 5 | Agent is stopped |

Limits reset per task. A coder working on Task 2.3 is not penalized for tool calls made during Task 2.2.

Per-agent overrides:

```json
{
  "guardrails": {
    "profiles": {
      "coder": { "max_tool_calls": 500, "max_duration_minutes": 60 },
      "explorer": { "max_tool_calls": 50 }
    }
  }
}
```

<summary><strong>Quality Gates (Technical Detail)</strong></summary>

### Built-in Tools

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| syntax_check | Tree-sitter validation across 9+ languages |
| placeholder_scan | Catches TODOs, FIXMEs, stubs, placeholder text |
| sast_scan | Offline security analysis, 63+ rules, 9 languages |
| sbom_generate | CycloneDX dependency tracking, 8 ecosystems |
| build_check | Runs your project's native build/typecheck |
| quality_budget | Enforces complexity, duplication, and test ratio limits |
| pre_check_batch | Runs lint, secretscan, SAST, and quality budget in parallel (~15s vs ~60s sequential) |

All tools run locally. No Docker, no network calls, no external APIs.

Optional enhancement: Semgrep (if on PATH).

## Testing

6,000+ tests. Unit, integration, adversarial, and smoke. Zero additional test dependencies.

```bash
bun test
```

---

## Design Principles

1. **Plan before code.** The critic approves the plan before a single line is written.
2. **One task at a time.** The coder gets one task and full context. Nothing else.
3. **Review everything immediately.** Correctness, security, tests, adversarial tests. Every task.
4. **Different models catch different bugs.** The coder's blind spot is the reviewer's strength.
5. **Save everything to disk.** Any session, any model, any day, pick up where you left off.
6. **Document failures.** Rejections and retries are recorded. After 5 failures, it escalates to you.

## Roadmap

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for shipped features.

Upcoming: v6.12 targets process violation hardening based on field testing with models that attempt to bypass QA gates.
