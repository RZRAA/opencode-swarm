## v6.11.0 - Architect Prompt Hardening (2026-02-26)

### Workflow Hardening

#### MODE Labels — Clear Architect Workflow Phases
Renamed internal workflow headers from "Phase N" to explicit MODE labels:
- `MODE: RESUME` — Resume detection
- `MODE: CLARIFY` — Requirement clarification
- `MODE: DISCOVER` — Codebase exploration
- `MODE: CONSULT` — SME consultation
- `MODE: PLAN` — Plan creation
- `MODE: CRITIC-GATE` — Plan review checkpoint
- `MODE: EXECUTE` — Task implementation
- `MODE: PHASE-WRAP` — Phase completion

**NAMESPACE RULE**: MODE labels refer to architect's internal workflow. Project plan phases remain "Phase N" in plan.md.

#### ⛔ HARD STOP — Pre-Commit Checklist
Mandatory 4-item checklist before marking any task complete:
- [ ] All QA gates passed (lint:check, secretscan, sast_scan)
- [ ] Reviewer approval documented
- [ ] Tests pass with evidence
- [ ] No security findings

There is no override. A commit without a completed QA gate is a workflow violation.

#### Observable Output — Required Print Statements
All blocking steps (5c-5m) now require explicit output:
```
→ REQUIRED: Print {description} on all blocking steps
```
Ensures visibility into gate progress and failure points.

### Task Quality Enforcement

#### Task Granularity Rules
Tasks classified as SMALL/MEDIUM/LARGE with decomposition requirements:
- **SMALL**: 1 file, single verb, <2 hours
- **MEDIUM**: 1-2 files, compound action, <4 hours
- **LARGE**: Must decompose into smaller tasks

#### Task Atomicity Checks
Critic validates tasks are not oversized:
- Max 2 files per task (otherwise decompose)
- No compound verbs ("and", "plus", "with") in task descriptions
- Clear acceptance criteria required

#### TASK COMPLETION CHECKLIST
Emit before marking task complete:
- Evidence written to `.swarm/evidence/{taskId}/`
- plan.md updated with `[x] task complete`
- Completion confirmation printed

### Failure Handling

#### FAILURE COUNTING
Retry counter with escalation after 5 failures:
```
RETRY #{count}/5
```

#### RETRY PROTOCOL
Structured rejection format on gate failure:
```
RETRY #{count}/5
FAILED GATE: {gate_name}
REASON: {specific failure}
REQUIRED FIX: {actionable instruction}
RESUME AT: {step_5x}
```

### Anti-Rationalization

#### ANTI-EXEMPTION RULES (8 patterns blocked)
The following rationalizations are explicitly blocked:
1. "It's a simple change"
2. "Just updating docs"
3. "Only a config tweak"
4. "Hotfix, no time for QA"
5. "The tests pass locally"
6. "I'll clean it up later"
7. "No logic changes"
8. "Already reviewed the pattern"

There are NO simple changes. There are NO exceptions to the QA gate sequence.

### Security

#### AUTHOR BLINDNESS WARNING
Added to coder prompt: warns against self-review bias and requires treating own code with same scrutiny as others'.

### Updated Phase 5 QA Gate Sequence

```
coder → diff → syntax_check → placeholder_scan → imports → 
lint fix → build_check → pre_check_batch (4 parallel: lint:check, secretscan, sast_scan, quality_budget) → 
reviewer → security review → verification tests → adversarial tests → coverage check → complete
```

**Note**: `secretscan` and `sast_scan` now run inside `pre_check_batch`, not as standalone steps.

### Files Changed
- `src/agents/architect.ts` — MODE labels, HARD STOP, observable output, anti-exemption rules
- `src/agents/critic.ts` — Task granularity checks, atomicity validation
- `src/agents/coder.ts` — Author blindness warning
- `tests/unit/agents/architect-gates.test.ts` — Gate sequence tests
- `tests/unit/agents/architect-v6-prompt.test.ts` — Prompt structure validation
- `tests/unit/agents/architect-workflow-security.test.ts` — Security gate tests
- `tests/unit/agents/architect-adversarial.test.ts` — Anti-rationalization tests

## v6.10.0 - Parallel Pre-Check Batch (2026-02-26)

### New Features

#### pre_check_batch - Parallel Verification Tooling

**4x faster QA gates** by running independent checks in parallel:

- **lint:check** - Code quality verification (hard gate)
- **secretscan** - Secret detection (hard gate)  
- **sast_scan** - Static security analysis with 63+ rules (hard gate)
- **quality_budget** - Maintainability threshold enforcement

**Benefits**:
- Reduces total gate time from ~60s (sequential) to ~15s (parallel)
- All tools run via `p-limit` with max 4 concurrent operations
- Individual tool timeouts (60s) prevent cascading failures
- Unified `gates_passed` boolean for simplified gate logic

### New Configuration

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "parallel_precheck": true  // default: true
  }
}
```

Set to `false` to run gates sequentially (useful for debugging or resource constraints).

### Updated Phase 5 QA Gate Sequence

```
coder → diff → syntax_check → placeholder_scan → imports → 
lint fix → build_check → pre_check_batch (parallel) → 
reviewer → security reviewer → test_engineer → coverage check
```

### System Hints

Architect receives hints about parallel vs sequential mode via system enhancer hook. Phase 5 prompt updated to use `pre_check_batch` after `build_check`.

### Dependencies

- Added `p-limit@7.3.0` for concurrency control

### Upgrade Guide

**No breaking changes.**

1. Update to v6.10.0
2. Parallel pre-check enabled by default
3. Set `pipeline.parallel_precheck: false` to disable if needed
4. Run `bun test` to verify installation

## v6.9.0 - Quality & Anti-Slop Tooling (2026-02-25)

### New Features

#### syntax_check - Tree-sitter Parse Validation
- Validates syntax across 9+ languages (JS/TS, Python, Go, Rust, Java, PHP, C, C++, C#)
- Uses Tree-sitter parsers for accurate error detection
- Runs before all other gates to catch syntax errors early

#### placeholder_scan - Anti-Slop Detection
- Detects TODO/FIXME/TBD/XXX comments in production code
- Identifies placeholder text and stub implementations
- Prevents shipping incomplete or "sloppy" code
- Configurable allow_globs for docs/tests directories

#### sast_scan - Static Security Analysis
- 63+ offline security rules across 9 languages
- High-signal, low false-positive detection
- Tier A: Built-in rules (always available)
- Tier B: Optional Semgrep integration (if on PATH)
- Rules cover: eval, command injection, deserialization, buffer overflow, etc.

#### sbom_generate - Dependency Tracking
- Generates CycloneDX v1.5 SBOMs
- Supports 8 ecosystems: Node.js, Python, Rust, Go, Java, .NET, Swift, Dart
- Parses lock files: package-lock.json, Cargo.lock, poetry.lock, go.sum, etc.
- Non-blocking evidence collection

#### build_check - Build Verification
- Runs repo-native build/typecheck commands
- Supports 10+ ecosystems with automatic detection
- Graceful skip when toolchain unavailable
- Captures build output for debugging

#### quality_budget - Maintainability Enforcement
- Enforces 4 quality metrics:
  - Complexity delta (cyclomatic complexity)
  - Public API delta (new exports)
  - Duplication ratio (copy-paste detection)
  - Test-to-code ratio (coverage proxy)
- Configurable thresholds per project
- Integrated with `/swarm benchmark --ci-gate`

### New Evidence Types
- `syntax` - Syntax check results
- `placeholder` - Placeholder scan findings
- `sast` - Security analysis findings
- `sbom` - Software Bill of Materials
- `build` - Build verification results
- `quality_budget` - Quality metrics and violations

### Configuration

New `gates` config section in `.opencode/swarm.json`:

```json
{
  "gates": {
    "syntax_check": { "enabled": true },
    "placeholder_scan": { "enabled": true },
    "sast_scan": { "enabled": true },

### Complete QA Gate Sequence

```
coder → diff → syntax_check → placeholder_scan → imports → 
lint → secretscan → sast_scan → build_check → quality_budget → 
reviewer → security reviewer → test_engineer → coverage check
```

### Local-Only Guarantee
